# Roblox-Linux-Launcher

Launch Roblox on Linux!

(Everything is still in development. Consider nothing to be complete.)

With the release of Wine 6.11, it is now possible to play Roblox on Linux. Roblox Linux Launcher has been rewritten from the ground up to quickly and easily launch your Roblox games.

## Features:
- Launch Roblox games quickly and easily
- All browsers supported through xdg-open
- Automatically detects new Roblox versions and adjusts the version to launch accordingly*

*Ensure you only have one version of Roblox installed before using Roblox Linux Launcher. I suggest making a fresh install of Roblox before using this program.

## Soon:

- Compiled version (no need to install python packages with `pip`, will use GUI for messages instead of terminal, and will include .desktop launcher)

## Dependencies:

- xdg-open from xdg-utils
- Wine 6.11 or greater (currently development branch)
- Roblox installation **with only one version installed (see above)**
- Python 3

## What about other launchers?
Of course, there are other launchers available to launch Roblox with. It really just comes down to personal preference. At the end of the day, a launcher is a launcher.
